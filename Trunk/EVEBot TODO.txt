I(Neutro) need
* Addition for bookmarks location (waiting for Ama to add Bookmark support to ISXEVE)
* queue'ing skills / auto learning (Almost done, just need to implement it)
* depends on cargo functions by ama but inventory in an array (id, name, location, type, etc) - On wait - 
* swapping guns, changing shields, repairing - on wait - 
* Chatter support (via IRC, MSN, AOL) - waiting for Ama to add Chat support to ISXEVE -
* Optimisation (+modular) - Cyber is doing it
* Pvp combat bot (warpto miner(s), check, destroy if enemies, warpto transporter(s), destroy if enemy, go back to base, repair, etc)
* Create a script that will automatically reconnect you after downtime (serverside)


User Interface Notes for Altered:
	[02:22] <CyberTech> https://www.isxgames.com/EVEBot/Trunk/EVEbot/interface/eveskin/ui_sample.png
	[02:22] <CyberTech> it needs a little work still
	[02:22] <CyberTech> but everything works
	[02:22] <CyberTech> all it needs is visual touchup work
	[02:23] <CyberTech> tab menu item colours, i like em, others might not
	[02:23] <CyberTech> the empty space on the sides of the tab control, could be filled in with background, could be ignored.
	[02:24] <CyberTech> the file tab_frametexture.png (previously optionswindow_main.png) needs redone
	[02:24] <CyberTech> to re-include the art you had around the corners, but remove the empty space at the top
	[02:24] <CyberTech> i spent 2 hours trying to remove that space in lavishgui before i figured out it must be in the png :)
	[02:25] <CyberTech> the Play button needs redone as "Run"
	[02:25] <CyberTech> Run, Pause, minimize and X buttons need redone for 20 high title instead of 16
