TO:DO

Stealthy: me? I'm just trying to get this shit up and smooth
Hessinger: want to make a GUI for this new version?
Hazard: start implementing Stealthy bookmarks
Neutro: Working on finding best ore mining location, on refine and sell

I(neutro) need
* Addition for bookmarks location (I(Neutro) am working on this)
* queue'ing skills / auto learning (Almost done)
* depends on cargo functions by ama but inventory in an array (id, name, location, type, etc)
* swapping guns, changing shields, repairing

GUI UPDATE:
[04:58] <@Hessinger> Anyways
[04:58] <@Hessinger> if i may not start this gui until ama gets cargo done and were up to speed and away from pixel clicking
[04:59] <@Hessinger> i had problems setting up the options page because there was no real easy way datatype to store x,y coords.
[04:59] <@Hessinger> soo....... if he doesn't get cargo done in next few days for w/e reason or has problems

DONE
<Neutro> i plan on adding a few core item to split it up, oMining, oCombat, oBase (refer to when you are instation))
