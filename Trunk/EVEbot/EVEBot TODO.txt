User Interface Notes for Altered:
	Altered: Return (or equiv_ button next to Pause which wiil be for forcing return to station
	
CyberTech:
	Adding Hauler module to EVEBot itself

	Change roid selection method, do 1 GetEntity call for all nearby astroids then iterate and exclude manually.
	% shield for shield booster activation
	Activation of shield and armor resist modules when attacked
	use the 200km bookmark request from da_teach
	Cuttoff for slowboating.. if roid is > 20 seconds away, warp to a new belt. Do not use if in 200km mode.
	Add an option to prefer moving to a lower roid type instead of warping in the above case
	new roid alg:
		target 10 of the best asteroids in the field
		using fromid, check for all asteroids within 25k of each of the 10
		using the new weighting from the config file, add up the total weight count of each of the 10 + surround asteroids
		head for the highest concentration area.
	check minimum range from all targets, not just one
	improve mining drone support
	
Requests:
<Da_Teach> gimme red/neutral detection and let me weight the rats in a belt and not mine in that belt if rat weight above x
