* Addition for bookmarks location (waiting for Ama to add Bookmark support to ISXEVE)
* queue'ing skills / auto learning (Almost done, just need to implement it)
* depends on cargo functions by ama but inventory in an array (id, name, location, type, etc) - On wait - 
* swapping guns, changing shields, repairing - on wait - 
* Chatter support (via IRC, MSN, AOL) - waiting for Ama to add Chat support to ISXEVE -
* Optimisation (+modular) - Cyber is doing it
* Pvp combat bot (warpto miner(s), check, destroy if enemies, warpto transporter(s), destroy if enemy, go back to base, repair, etc)
* Create a script that will automatically reconnect you after downtime (serverside)



User Interface Notes for Altered:
	[02:22] <CyberTech> https://www.isxgames.com/EVEBot/Trunk/EVEbot/interface/eveskin/ui_sample.png
	[02:22] <CyberTech> it needs a little work still
	[02:22] <CyberTech> but everything works
	[02:22] <CyberTech> all it needs is visual touchup work
	[02:23] <CyberTech> tab menu item colours, i like em, others might not
	[02:23] <CyberTech> the empty space on the sides of the tab control, could be filled in with background, could be ignored.
	[02:24] <CyberTech> the file tab_frametexture.png (previously optionswindow_main.png) needs redone
	[02:24] <CyberTech> to re-include the art you had around the corners, but remove the empty space at the top
	[02:24] <CyberTech> i spent 2 hours trying to remove that space in lavishgui before i figured out it must be in the png :)
	[02:25] <CyberTech> the Play button needs redone as "Run"
	[02:25] <CyberTech> Run, Pause, minimize and X buttons need redone for 20 high title instead of 16
	Altered: Return (or equiv_ button next to Pause which wiil be for forcing return to station
	

CyberTech:
	% shield for shiedl booster activation
	use the 200km bookmark request from da_teach
	Cuttoff for slowboating.. if roid is > 20 seconds away, warp to a new belt. Do not use if in 200km mode.
	Add an option to prefer moving to a lower roid type instead of warping in the above case
	new roid alg:
		target 10 of the best asteroids in the field
		using fromid, check for all asteroids within 25k of each of the 10
		using the new weighting from the config file, add up the total weight count of each of the 10 + surround asteroids
		head for the highest concentration area.
	check minimum range from all miners, not just one
	add mining drone support
	
Requests:
<Da_Teach> gimme red/neutral detection and let me weight the rats in a belt and not mine in that belt if rat weight above x
