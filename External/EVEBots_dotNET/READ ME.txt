You MUST have isboxer installed to use this! Get it from http://www.lavishsoft.com/wiki/index.php/IS:ISBoxer

EVEBOTS requires you set up the following

1.The launcher script , instructions here http://eve.isxgames.com/wiki/index.php?title=Autologin
You must set up a launcher profile for each character you wish to use
2. Innerspace profiles , you need to add a new innerspace profile for every character you wish to use
in the startup sequence you have to add "run evebot/launcher YOURCHARACTERNAME"
3. An isboxer profile set up with a charset filled with the characters you want to use, make sure you set up each character to use the correct profile
4. For each character find evebot/config/yourcharacter.xml , replace the line "<Setting Name="Callback">FALSE</Setting>" with "<Setting Name="Callback">TRUE</Setting>"
5. Compile the project in the C# stuff directory using visual studio 2008 and place the evebots executable in innerspace/.NET Programs directory


Once this is done simply type "dotnet evebots" into your innerspace console *the innerspace console NOT the one in eve , its the one you get when you double click on the innerspace icon in your system tray
