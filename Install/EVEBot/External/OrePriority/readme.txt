OrePriority -- On the fly priority change! For EVEBot Stable or Stable_Beta

    Simple script, simple concept. Provides a UI to change priority and types of ore you wish to mine.

    Extract both files from the zip into scripts folder, or scripts/evebot folder, and run orepriority.iss after running EVEBot. 
    EVEBot *MUST* be running for this script to function, but does not need to be "started".

    Highlight ores you wish to mine, using ctrl+click for multi-select. As soon as you click the Update button, the priorities will be 
    hanged in the running EVEBot. EVEBot will then save them to your config file when closed.

    You may drag lines to sort them in the order you wish to mine. The bot will mine from top to bottom.

    Please note that I will not be supporting this script, and I am releasing it on an as-is basis. There may be bugs, but in general 
    this worked for me every time I used it.
